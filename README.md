Client

Rewind Clothing Store is a clothing resale shop in Issaquah whose product focus is recent fashion in like-new condition — “gently-used,” store owner Dawna Russell likes to say. Upper-income women in the area bring in their unwanted Prada, etc, to get some cash; middle income women and their daughters buy recent fashions in top condition at prices they could never afford new. Clientele is women ages 16-40.

Rewind also has relationships with local artists and craftspeople whose wares are featured in the store. Dawna is very interested in helping the community — both her clientele and the artistic community, and in helping clothing to continue to be used and appreciated rather than being discarded into landfill.
Project

The Client had been using a service which offers free website building with paid hosting and was dissatisfied with the look this free site gave to her business. She wanted not only to inform people about Rewind, but also to give it an image of “High-end with Bargains”.

Issues

How and what Rewind buys

Dawna maintains a delicate balance by offering high-end womens’ clothing and accessories at modest prices. Buyers have only so much to spend, and this limits how much money Sellers can get for their pre-owned items. The business model works simply because the Sellers get tired of their clothes and accessories, and would rather get some cash than tie up all their closet space. And Buyers know they can get high-end fashion they could never afford new.

Guidelines for accepting clothing are stringent but simple: no stains, smells or defects, and nothing more than 1 year old. All clothing is steam-cleaned upon acceptance by the store and shoppers are treated to a pleasant experience 100% free of the odors common to other clothing resale shops.

Visual elements

Getting the color and photography right is crucial to any clothing store, but perhaps more so in the resale sector, because visitors to the site need to be convinced that they’ll encounter some real finds, not picked-over cast-offs. Dawna wanted to work in Pink and Hot-Pink. Since these colors can be very fatiguing, we walked it back to a palette still rich in pinks and reds, but not so jarring to the eyes.
Not your mother’s (or daughter’s) clothing!

Rewind’s target demo is women age 16 to 40. This includes single and married professionals, stay-at-home moms, and daughters dependent on Mom for their clothing budget.

Store offerings have to reflect tastes of women across this spectrum. The daughters won’t even come unless they know they can get what all their friends are wearing. Moms won’t come if the clothes aren’t good at reasonable prices. And professional women don’t want to go to a teen shop any more than teens want to dress like their mothers.

The site must convey, to all of these groups: “We have what you want.” Fresh, upbeat, current, affordable, with a de-emphasis on fad items that won’t last the year.
